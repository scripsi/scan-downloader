# IV-Viewer

The code for this JPEG viewer is taken from this project:

https://github.com/s-yadav/iv-viewer

It allows for a zoomable, pannable image with a very minimal interface and overhead. The css and js are taken directly from the `dist` folder of the project (on 4th Feb 2022). The html just creates a blank full-frame image that can be loaded into an iframe and reset to the target image.
